## 0.2.0 - 2021-05-03
### Changes
Split up generation of bindings and use of pre-generated bindings from repository:

- Now `bindgen` (and corresponding client libraries such as `libmysqlclient-dev` and `llvm-dev` libraries 
  described at **[Build](https://github.com/chamoretto/mysql-client-bindings-rs#build)** section) 
  is optional dependency, why - see the points below.
- Now bindings will NOT be generated by default, default behaviour now is using of pre-generated bindings.
- New feature `fresh_bindings` enables generating of new bindings for every run instead of using precompiled from repository.

### Fix
- Due to previous points, this library also now have docs accessible from [docs.rs](https://docs.rs).

## 0.1.2 - 2021-05-02
### Fix
- Add `rustfmt.toml` to `build.rs` and to dockerfiles 
  in order to avoid differences between docker- and host-generated bindings.
- Fix crate version at README.md - now it is 0.1.2, version corresponding to crates.io release.
